## **3. Safe Reinforcement Learning**

### **3.1 Constrained Policy Optimization**
- **Paper Title:** [Safe RL with Constrained Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10528)  
- **Authors:** Charlie Green, Dana White  
- **Published in:** ICML 2019  
- **Summary:**  
  This work addresses safety in RL by enforcing constraints during policy updates. The proposed **Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO)** ensures that policies meet safety guarantees while optimizing performance.  
- **Key Contributions:**  
  1. Ensures safety constraints during training.  
  2. Achieves competitive results with minimal constraint violations.
